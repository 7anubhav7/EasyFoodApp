It is a robust, simple and easy to use recipe app that will provide recipes of various categories of food across the world. You can see what is popular, view various randomly promoted recipes, search a recipe of your own choice, or browse the categories section for a thorough find. Opening any recipe will forward you to another activity page that will list the recipe instructions in detail, its category and even see a youtube video tutorial of the recipe. You can also add any recipe to your favorites tab as well, and delete it whenever you desire. You can also undo this delete if it is done by mistake.
